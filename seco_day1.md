If you see something interesting from either the Dashboards or Alerts screen, you can quickly pivot to the Hunt screen by left-clicking the Alert or Event, expanding the Actions dropdown, then clicking the Hunt button.

If you find interesting network traffic, you can pivot to full packet capture via the PCAP action. This is found from within the same action menu as Drilldown and Hunt. From within this screen, you can change the view to an ASCII transcript OR send the pcap to CyberChef.

Finally, the below is a simplified example workflow using Security Onion:
- Go to the Alerts page and review any unacknowledged alerts.
- Review Dashboards for anything that looks suspicious.
- Once you’ve found something that you want to investigate, you might want to pivot to Hunt to expand your search and look for additional logs relating to the source and destination IP addresses.
- If any of those alerts or logs look interesting, you might want to pivot to PCAP to review the full packet capture for the entire stream.
- Depending on what you see in the stream, you might want to send it to CyberChef for further analysis and decoding.
